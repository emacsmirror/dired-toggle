*** Description:
    =dired-toggle= provide an simple way to toggle dired buffer for
    current directory, and the target buffer is specified so that it
    will be divided from other dired buffers, for example the dired
    buffer only shown in a special buffer which could be edit through
    the variable =dired-toggle-buffer-name=, and it will include a
    minor mode named =dired-toggle-mode= to ensure all the actions
    (such as change directory and open a selected file) under the
    dired buffer will not influence other dired buffers and works as
    we expected.

    You could custom the toggled window's size and side through
    variable =dired-toggle-window-size= and
    =dired-toggle-window-side=.

*** Install
    You could install it easily through =melpa` by typing =M-x
    package-install dired-toggle`

*** Usage:
    Add the following to your =.emacs=:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "<f3>") 'dired-toggle)
    #+END_SRC

    you could also custom functions after =dired-toggle-mode= enabled,
    for example enable =visual-line-mode= for our narrow dired buffer:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook 'dired-toggle-mode-hook
              (lambda () (interactive)
                (visual-line-mode 1)
                (setq-local visual-line-fringe-indicators '(nil right-curly-arrow))
                (setq-local word-wrap nil)))
    #+END_SRC
